# DSA-COURSE-SEM-3
This repository contains all the code files and implementations developed during the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Course in C in Semester 3. The code examples are designed to cover various data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques taught in the course. 

## Key Topics Covered
### Data Structures

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Graphs (DFS, BFS, Shortest Paths)
- and some applications like infix to postfix

### Algorithms

- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort)
